"A USB flash drive is just storage for private keys. It means that when you "

"On the contrary, BWallet is a single-purpose computer, which stores your "
"private keys and actively signs transactions without sending your private "
"keys to the computer. When you want to make a bitcoin transaction, your "
"bitcoin software just sends a transaction template to the BWallet device and"
" asks for a digital signature. BWallet shows the requested amount and target"
" address on its display. You will then confirm the transaction by pressing "
"the hardware button. BWallet will sign transaction internally and send the "
"digital signature back to the computer, without leaking your private keys. "

"when you want to send some coins out of your wallet, BWallet asks bitcoin "
