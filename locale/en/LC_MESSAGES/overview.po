"BWallet is a single purpose device which allows you to make secure Bitcoin "
"transactions. With BWallet, transactions are completely safe even when "
"initiated on a compromised or vulnerable computer.  Because the use of "
"BWallet is very easy and intuitive we believe it will help Bitcoin adoption "
"among common people."

msgid "How does BWallet work?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.rst:14
msgid ""
"The Bitcoin protocol works by sending signed notes of payment across the "
"Internet.  These messages(which are referred to as Transactions) are signed "
"using a special algorithm.  In order to sign a Bitcoin transaction you need "
"to have a special key or password.  BWallet holds that key.  Since BWallet's"
" job is to help you securely sign Transaction messages, you can think of you"
" BWallet as a modern day stamp."

"BWallet is better than an ordinary mechanical stamping mechanism, however.  "
"Each BWallet has a PIN code. If your BWallet gets stolen, thieves cannot "
"misuse it to steal your money.  Due to BWallet's clever design, even if the "
"computer with which you use your BWallet is hacked, the hackers will never "
"know your PIN."

"In contrast to the various pieces of software and web services that allow "
"you to store your Bitcoins BWallet is secure.  Software and web based "
"solutions keep your Bitcoin signing keys either on your computer, or worse, "
"on the Internet!  When you use such a service, hackers can easily steal your"
" Bitcoins by hacking your computers or hacking the servers of the services "
"that you use."
