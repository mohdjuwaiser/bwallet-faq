msgid "Your BWallet is protected by a PIN code, which can be up to 10 digits between 1 and 9.  There are 6561 possible 4 digit PINs for the BWallet.  If you choose a good PIN, it will take hundreds to thousands of guesses to guess your PIN.  Each time you enter a wrong PIN, the wait time increases by a power of 2.  After the first few failures, you have to wait several seconds before you'll be able to try another PIN.  Even just trying the `top 20 PINs <http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/>`_ would take about 6 days(150 hours). Trying 30 PINs would take around 17 years.  Trying 100 random PINs would take a VERY LONG time."

I'm no science fiction author, but my guess is -- this might be possible.  However, the Cortex M3 is a sensitive multilayer chip.  The components inside are much smaller than those fake eBay amps.  Chances are, all you'd end up doing is destroying the chip.  Even if you succeeded in doing so, this will be a costly and time consuming task.  In the end the bitcoins will already gone because the original owner will have `changed their recovery seed <http://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/advanced_features.html#changing-your-trezor-recovery-seed>`_ upon discovering that their BWallet was stolen."

You can `verify the build yourself <https://github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu/blob/master/README.rst>`_.  Our hope is that a few trusted BWallet users will make a habit of verifying firmware checksums.  If you are concerned about this, we suggest making a habit of checking `our blog <http://satoshilabs.com/news>`_ or social news channels such as `reddit <http://www.reddit.com/r/BWallet>`_ before applying any updates.
