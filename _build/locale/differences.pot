msgid "On the contrary, BWallet is a single-purpose computer, which stores your private keys and actively signs transactions without sending your private keys to the computer. When you want to make a bitcoin transaction, your bitcoin software just sends a transaction template to the BWallet device and asks for a digital signature. BWallet shows the requested amount and target address on its display. You will then confirm the transaction by pressing the hardware button. BWallet will sign transaction internally and send the digital signature back to the computer, without leaking your private keys. Thanks to this, you can use BWallet even on a vulnerable or hacked computer."

There's no point where malware on your computer could access the private keys or send away your coins without your permission."
