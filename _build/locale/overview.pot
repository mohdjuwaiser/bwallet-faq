msgid "BWallet is a single purpose device which allows you to make secure Bitcoin transactions. With BWallet, transactions are completely safe even when initiated on a compromised or vulnerable computer.  Because the use of BWallet is very easy and intuitive we believe it will help Bitcoin adoption among common people."

# daea19f5a7c64510b0aad9201f9c1d47
msgid "The Bitcoin protocol works by sending signed notes of payment across the Internet.  These messages(which are referred to as Transactions) are signed using a special algorithm.  In order to sign a Bitcoin transaction you need to have a special key or password.  BWallet holds that key.  Since BWallet's job is to help you securely sign Transaction messages, you can think of you BWallet as a modern day stamp."

msgid "BWallet is better than an ordinary mechanical stamping mechanism, however.  Each BWallet has a PIN code. If your BWallet gets stolen, thieves cannot misuse it to steal your money.  Due to BWallet's clever design, even if the computer with which you use your BWallet is hacked, the hackers will never know your PIN."

msgid "In contrast to the various pieces of software and web services that allow you to store your Bitcoins BWallet is secure.  Software and web based solutions keep your Bitcoin signing keys either on your computer, or worse, on the Internet!  When you use such a service, hackers can easily steal your Bitcoins by hacking your computers or hacking the servers of the services that you use."
